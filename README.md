## Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum:(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript) a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game.

## Functionality
- Players are allowed to add marks to a specific spot on the board.
- There's a reset button that resets the board.

## Thoughts
The goal of the project was to step up my patter design implementing modules and factory functions. 
I really like starting to focus on the design patter of my solutions, even though it is not easy, I can really start seeing its advantage over just throwing every function on my .js files. It also gives the code a more clean and professional look.

## TODO
- Styling: Just as all the projects in this JavaScript course, I will only focus on the js side of the projects, and will come back when doing the HTML/CSS course to make the UI prettier and responsive.
- AI: I will also come back to add a "play vs AI" option, and implement an "AI" using the minimax algorithm.
